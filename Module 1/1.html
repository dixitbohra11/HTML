(1) No, HTML tags and elements are not the same thing, although they are related.
    In HTML, a tag is a markup element that begins with a less-than symbol ("<") and 
    ends with a greater-than symbol (">"). For example, the <p> tag is used to define a paragraph of text in HTML.

    An element, on the other hand, is a combination of one or more tags, along with any content that is contained within those tags.
    For example, the <p> element might contain a block of text, along with any other tags that are nested inside it.

    So, in summary, HTML tags are individual markup elements, while HTML elements are combinations of one or more tags, along with any content they contain.
